To view and play the game, please click on the following link: https://github.com/Eucaa/Sailor-Moon-Memory-Card-Game

This game has been created for leisurely entertainment for multiple ages. The genre is from the international well-know and renouded Japanese manga- and animation sereis Sailor Moon.
The game lets people find a match of two cards of the same image. Two turned cards count as one move. ItÅ› best to make as less moves as possible. 
If all matches are found before the count-down timer expires, they will be able to enjoy a unique image of small animation of the main charater Sailor Moon.
Clearance of a higher stage will result into a nicer animated reward.


## UX 
Since the game is aiming for the enjoyment of multiple ages, the page has been created to keep it's appearance as simple and clean as possible.
The game will allow fans of the genre or the series to enjoy "looking" for their favorite charater and let other people get introduced with the concept of Japanese animations and these popular icons.
A background animation has been added to make the game look more interactive and appealing. But will not take your interest of from finishing the game.
And page load, a modal will activate with intrsuction on how to play the game. A button is added on the bottom right of this modal. To start the actual game, this buttom can be clicked.
The game is prvided with three stages of difficulties. The completion of the individual stages of the game will show the player a unique animation of the the main character of the series.
All different pop-ups include a play again button, to replay the game of choose anther level, but also a close (X) option which will not start a new game but just let you stay on the page.
If not all tiles are turned correclty within the countdown of the timer, a separate pop-up will be shown and will allow you to start a new game.
All pop-ups available in the game include an overview of how many moves in total were made and how many seconds it took them to make them.
All pop-ups of the three stages include a unique animation. The higher stages will include a better becoming animation to make clearing it more exciting.
New images are added into the game at the higher stages to let the user get introduced to new charaters.  
A "mute sound" option is added to the top left of the screen to make it able to mute the starting- tune.

## Features
How-to-Play function - Showing a pop-up with instructions on how to play the game, what NOT to do to prevent unnecessary move-loss and what reward can be expected with completion. Pressing "start game" will (re)start the game.
Times-up function - Shows the user how many moves have been made within the time limit, including a "try-again" to reload the game and start again.
Success function - This pop-up will only show if all tiles have been matched within the time limit. Each stage will have a different image. The last stage will include a nice little gif with a special animation.
Tile block - Pevents from clicking on more than 2 cards at once.
Stage leves - The game includes different levels (stages) that will include more tiles with every stage (level).
Mute sound - This will mute the sounds of the opening tune that will be played when the has been reloaded.

## Existing Features
Side stress clicking is blocked. If user click aside from the cards instead of on it, the game will not stress will not respond. 

While it is not possible to stress the game out when clicking aside from the tiles, there is still some difficulties when clicking too many times on a tile itself. 
A note for this has been given in the shape of a penalty in the How-to-Play feature.

A "mute sound" option has been provided to close the sound of the opnening tune at the start of the game.

## Future features
* Adding different backgrounds for every stage level and including other background animations.
* Adding more stage levels.
* Improving the functionality of the tiles itself when monkey testing.

### CSS
CSS3 has been used for styling the game.

### JavaScript
JavaScript has been used to implement the functionalities of the tile creation, shuffling the tiles and showing the correct pop-ups when the count-down timer has ended.

### JQuery
JQuery has been used to show my understanding of this library and to simplify the DOM tree traversal and manipulation.

### Bootstrap
The project uses Bootstrap to allow for extra responsiveness of the html5- and JavaScript files.

### Google Fonts
The project uses Google Fonts to apply fonts "Great Vibes" and "Oswald" to the webpage.

### Testing
The HTML and CSS coding was tested by using the W3C Mark Validator Service by direct input.
To test the responsiveness of the website in phones, tablets, and desktops screens, I have used the Chrome Developer Tools, verifying how the site reacted in different screen sizes.
The JavaScript files were tested using https://jshint.com/ by direct input of the files on the validator.
The game has been tested by some of my friends with the question if the game was clear, easy to use and understandable.

### Bugs
Had some issues with the re-sizing of the tiles on smaller devices. 

### Deployment
The project was developed using the AWS IDE. New features or changes made to the code, were added and committed to the local repository. 
After, the changes were pushed and added to my Github repository. The project was deployed using GitHub.
